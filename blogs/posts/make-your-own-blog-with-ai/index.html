              <p>This is a story of how I made my own blogging system with AI (which you are reading on the same system). If you want to go through my reasons for why I made my own system, here they are [1] - but really speaking I wanted to have some fun building with AI! I have been wanting to have a nice blog/homepage for a good while now, and no better time to build it with AI assistants at your fingertips!</p><p>Here I will describe my journey along with screenshots. I will also describe the strengths of AI assistants, how to guide them, and where they start hitting their limits. This post assumes some understanding of systems, programming, etc., but not at the level of an expert frontend engineer (which I am absolutely not, I do not even have basic expertise). In fact, I learned a lot during this journey as well as struggled figuring frontend things in this journey but my AI assistant was with me to help me through.</p><h2><strong>Step 1: Choose a capable frontier model.</strong></h2><p>I chose my current favorite: Claude Sonnet. Love the model and also its name!</p><p></p><h2><strong>Step 2: Brainstorm and make it clear to AI assistant.</strong></h2><p>AI models are trigger-happy to implement stuff and show off. They'd try to throw in bunch of optimizations, assuming you are an expert. This can really produce a big mess and it is best to stay away from it. What works for me is that I start brainstorming with the AI assistants and make it clear that I am not looking for the implementation. It is best to clarify the following things to the AI model the following things:</p><ul><li><p>Simplicity: Clarify if you looking for PoC or a more advanced version.</p></li><li><p>User stories: Explain what is the behavior or workflows you are looking for.</p></li><li><p>System Spec: A rough idea of the system you are tying to build.</p></li></ul><p>For example, I began my conversation with Claude as follows. Overall I think Claude also slowly figures out your comfort level with the code.</p><blockquote><p>I want to create my blog publishing system that publishes static blog website.</p><ol><li><p>A blog post has the following parts: content (html page), assets (images, video, files, etc.), and metadata (published date, author, tags, etc.) get saved in GitHub.</p></li><li><p>A node.js app for serving to the user using Carbon Design system renders the app and metadata. There's no backend, the app makes in-browser requests to get next post data and renders it.</p></li><li><p>A node.js browser-local app for creating the above content - which will have either a user-friendly rich-text or html editor. It'll show me preview of the page as it'd be published. Once approved, it'll push post to the GitHub.</p></li></ol><p>Note that these apps could essentially be a single app, where one of the builds will be eventually deployed. The creator part will be run only on machine locally.</p><p>Let's start brainstorming with high-level system plan thinking. No implementation or code at this stage.</p></blockquote><p>--</p><p>[1]  </p><ul><li><p>There are wordpress, medium and their kind but honestly the themes I like there cost money. </p></li><li><p>There are options like running <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link" href="https://heidloff.net/article/welcome-to-new-jekyll-based-blog/">Jekyll Server</a> which require more dev expertise and are based on Markdown. I needed something which has a more natural editor feel.</p></li><li><p>I should have the ability to tinker with html/css/js directly to create fun dynamic demos.</p></li></ul>
